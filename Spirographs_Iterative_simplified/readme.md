Digital Spirographs
===================

Digital Spirographs is a Processing sketch, and needs the Processing IDE to run. You can grab it from the [Processing.org](https://processing.org/) site. 

It generates a series of spirographs and saves them to a folder ('Saved Files'). 

This code is pretty rough and ready, but pretty good fun as well. It's open source under the MIT licence - download it, play with it, do whatever you like. 

I wrote a piece with a bit more information about [my little Processing experiments](https://medium.com/@Haje/a26eb4041cbe).
